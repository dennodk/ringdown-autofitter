# ringdown-autofitter
A recurrent neural network self-study project for automizing data fitting of mechanical ringdown data using tensorflow. Some measurements are textbook clean. Some are imperfect. Some are poor or extremely noisy, or might have abrupt jumps here and there. The aim is to use the data as a test bed for studying RNN to make a general purpose model for fitting all kinds of ringdown data. In short, the finale model works quite well.

See attached figures for results. Red are the data points. Green are points I've originally chosen for the ringdown slope fit. The black dots are points my neural network chose for the fit.
